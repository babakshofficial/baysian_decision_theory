## Features
- **Bayesian Classifiers**: Implements MAP and ML estimations for Bayesian inference.
- **Gaussian Distribution Analysis**: Functions for Gaussian distribution, both singular and multivariate.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Calculates classification accuracy and generates confusion matrices for model evaluation.

## Installation
To set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/babakshofficial/baysian_decision_theory.git
   cd baysian_decision_theory
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**:
   Make sure Python 3 is installed. Use the following to install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   If a `requirements.txt` file is not available, install necessary libraries manually (e.g., `numpy`).

## Usage
Each module is designed to be run individually or imported for custom workflows:

1. **Bayesian Inference**:
   ```bash
   python Bayes.py
   ```
2. **Maximum Likelihood Estimation (ML)**:
   ```bash
   python ML.py
   ```
3. **Maximum a Posteriori Estimation (MAP)**:
   ```bash
   python MAP.py
   ```
4. **Classification Accuracy**:
   ```bash
   python class_accuracy.py
   ```
   
### Example Usage
You can also use individual functions within Python:

```python
from gaussian_distribution import Gaussian

# Example usage for Gaussian distribution
gauss = Gaussian(mean=0, variance=1)
sample = gauss.sample()
print("Generated sample:", sample)
```
